x = 4
print("x =", x)

x = 4.45
print("x =", x)

x = "snakes"
print("x =", x)

z = 2
y = z + 1
print("z =", z)
print("y =", y)

print("z is greater than y:", (z > y))

print("z is equal to integer value of 2:", (z == 2))

print("z is equal to the string value of 2:", (z == "2"))

## Challenge 1
## Print the average between any two numbers
## You may define variables to hold the two numbers and one variable to hold the answer

## Challenge 2
## Add two strings together and print the result

## Challenge 3
